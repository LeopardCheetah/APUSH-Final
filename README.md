Code that I made for my US History (AP) Class's final project.    

Install this by clicking on `final_final.py` and copying all the code into the appropriate file.    
Run with `py [file_name]` on whatever file name you save the code to.   
   
  
----   

Note: I downsize heavily in this project since I didn't really want to do this project -> didn't spend much time on it.   
Also note that this is all hardcoded.   
Also also note that I expected this to run on my teacher's machine (tihs didn't work out since I had pip problems) so I had to assume that this would be converted into a .exe which means no randomness (`import random`) would be able to be used. Thus this is a very bland program.  

Enjoy :)
